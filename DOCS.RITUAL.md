# DOCS.RITUAL.md â€” Living Explanation

Documentation keeps the system accessible. Whenever behaviour or intent shifts, update the words that describe it.

- Player-facing guides live in `DOCS.PLAYERS.md`.
- Maintainer notes live in `DOCS.MAINTAINERS.md`.
- Each system or library includes its own `README.md` when substantial.
- A change without documentation is incomplete.

Write docs as if you were returning after months away. Clarity over completeness.
