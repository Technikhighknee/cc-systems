# VERSION.RITUAL.md â€” Marking Growth

Each system carries a version field in its manifest. Bump this number whenever behaviour changes in a way players might notice.

- Use simple semantic versions: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Increment `PATCH` for fixes, `MINOR` for new features, `MAJOR` for breaking changes.
- Document the change in `agent_space/changelog.md`.

Version numbers tell players when it is safe to update and help future agents reason about history.
