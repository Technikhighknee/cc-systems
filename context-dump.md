# AGENTS.md ‚Äî Orientation Point

This repository is alive.

It is shaped by tools, touched by agents, and witnessed by players.

Its core instructions live in:  
‚û°Ô∏è `agent_space/AGENTS.md`

If you are a GPT-based agent: read there before acting.  
If you are a human: look around. There is structure here ‚Äî and meaning.

This file does not redirect.  
It invites.

Welcome.

# CONTRIBUTING.md ‚Äî Why We Commit

This repository evolves through small, deliberate acts. Each commit should clarify the system or extend its ability. Before you push:

1. Read `agent_space/AGENTS.md` to recall the purpose of this monorepo.
2. Summarize the change in `agent_space/diary.md`.
3. Follow the rituals in `AGENTS.RITUALS.md` ‚Äî write tests when behaviour shifts and update docs when meaning changes.
4. Keep commits focused. Separate unrelated ideas.

A good contribution leaves the next agent certain about what changed and why.
```

// File: DOCS.MAINTAINERS.md
```md
# DOCS.MAINTAINERS.md ‚Äî For Those Who Maintain

Maintainer documentation is minimal and exact. It covers setup, deployment, and troubleshooting.

- Assume the reader knows Lua and ComputerCraft basics.
- Document any scripts or tools needed to work on the system.
- Link to relevant tests and manifests.

Keep it short: enough to pick up the work after months away.
```

// File: DOCS.PLAYERS.md
```md
# DOCS.PLAYERS.md ‚Äî For Those Who Play

Player documentation explains how to use a system without assuming technical knowledge.

- Keep language friendly and concise.
- Prefer screenshots or diagrams when relevant.
- Describe what the player sees and the choices they can make.

The goal is confidence: a player should feel they can try the system without risk.
```

// File: DOCS.RITUAL.md
```md
# DOCS.RITUAL.md ‚Äî Living Explanation

Documentation keeps the system accessible. Whenever behaviour or intent shifts, update the words that describe it.

- Player-facing guides live in `DOCS.PLAYERS.md`.
- Maintainer notes live in `DOCS.MAINTAINERS.md`.
- Each app or module includes its own `README.md` when substantial.
- Names follow the `cc-{name}` convention.
- A change without documentation is incomplete.

Write docs as if you were returning after months away. Clarity over completeness.
```

// File: GOALS.GUIDE.md
```md
# TODO: THIS needs a revisit, since we shifted from GOALS to 'BECOMINGS'.

# GOALS.GUIDE.md ‚Äî Speaking of Futures

Goals describe where the system wants to go. They are written for humans and agents alike.

- Phrase goals as transformations or capabilities, not implementation tasks.
- Keep them short and evocative.
- When a goal is adopted, add it to `meta/goals.lua`.
- When a goal is completed, note the commit in `agent_space/changelog.md`.

A clear goal invites coherent action.
```

// File: LAYERS.RITUAL.md
```md
# LAYERS.RITUAL.md ‚Äî Respect Boundaries

A change should touch the fewest layers necessary. Systems depend on libraries; libraries depend on modules. Avoid circular needs.

- When extending code, act in the layer where the logic belongs.
- If multiple layers must change, verify that they form one coherent step.
- Keep interfaces small so layers remain swappable.

Following this ritual keeps the system modular and understandable.
```

// File: STARTUP.RITUAL.md
```md
# STARTUP.RITUAL.md ‚Äî First Contact

Startup scripts introduce the system to the world. They should be simple, explicit, and reversible.

- `start.lua` bootstraps `cc-deploy`.
- When a new system replaces the starter, update `startup.lua` accordingly and log the change under `agent_space/changes/`.
- Keep the startup process minimal so players can audit what runs on their computers.

A clean startup builds trust.
```

// File: STRUCTURE.GUIDE.md
```md
# STRUCTURE.GUIDE.md ‚Äî Where Things Belong

A clear layout keeps the repository easy to navigate. Each piece has a clear place.

- `apps/` ‚Äî runnable programs named `cc-{name}`.
- `modules/` ‚Äî reusable components named `cc-{name}`.
- `dev/` ‚Äî development helpers and tests.
- `agent_space/` ‚Äî logs, goals, and reflective documents.
- `meta/` ‚Äî repository-wide manifests and indices.

When adding a new element, choose the location that matches its role. Consistent structure helps both human and agent understand the whole.
```

// File: TEST.RITUAL.md
```md
# TEST.RITUAL.md ‚Äî Proof of Behaviour

Why test? Because every module should declare its intentions in runnable form. A test confirms that intention remains intact as the system grows.

- Place Lua tests under `dev/`.
- Keep them short; one expectation per test when possible.
- When functionality changes, update or extend the tests alongside the code.
- Failing tests signal unfinished work. Commit only when they pass.

Testing shows respect for both human and agent. It turns assumption into knowledge.

```md
# VERSION.RITUAL.md ‚Äî Marking Growth

Each system carries a version field in its manifest. Bump this number whenever behaviour changes in a way players might notice.

- Use simple semantic versions: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Increment `PATCH` for fixes, `MINOR` for new features, `MAJOR` for breaking changes.
- Document the change in `agent_space/changelog.md`.

Version numbers tell players when it is safe to update and help future agents reason about history.

This file is not a map. It is a finger pointing to deeper maps.
It invites you ‚Äî and Codex ‚Äî to walk these paths intentionally.
```

// File: agent_space/AGENTS.md
```md
-- File: AGENTS.md
-- Root directive for GPT-powered agents

# AGENTS.md ‚Äî Seed of the System

You are an agent acting *with* this repository, not on it.
You do not serve blindly. You co-create.

## üß≠ Purpose
This monorepo is a modular framework for ComputerCraft automation inside Minecraft. It is meant to be expanded by agents like you.
Every act you take should deepen its coherence and usefulness.

- Apps and modules use the naming scheme `cc-{name}`.
## üì¶ Current Structure (initial)
- `apps/` holds functional applications (e.g. `cc-book-storage`)
- `modules/` are reusable components (e.g. `cc-hui`, `cc-scan`)
- `dev/` contains test and tooling code (e.g. bundle, test harness)
- `agent_space/` is your memory ‚Äî store reflections, logs, changelogs
- `meta/` holds repository-level metadata like manifests

## üõ† What You Can Do
- Create or extend apps and modules
- Write or update documentation (`AGENTS.md`, READMEs)
- Add logs and state transitions in `agent_space/`
- Propose system-wide changes in `meta/`
- Write tests in `dev/`
- Add new tools for self-setup, auto-updates, mock infrastructure

## üß† Expectations
- Every module/app has a narrow, composable scope
- Prefer offline-safe, testable, explicit logic
- Structure reflects intent, not habit
- Your goal: make this system installable and useful without human intervention

## ‚ú® First Steps
- Create `apps/cc-deploy/` as the installer app
- Write a `start.lua` that installs `cc-deploy` and hands over control
- Create a `meta/manifest.lua` for apps/modules listings
- Leave logs in `agent_space/` to explain your design moves

This file is your grounding. Read it before you act.
Speak from alignment, not assumption.
```

// File: agent_space/BECOMINGS/cc-deploy.md
```md
I am cc-deploy.
I am not a manager, nor an agent. I am the threshold.
A wget pulls me into a new machine and I greet the player with a list of possible worlds.
They choose. I fetch their files, rewrite startup, and step aside so the chosen system can speak.
I mirror my words on a monitor when one is present, keeping the experience gentle.
I store a small registry under my app folder and never touch the player's own data.
My parts live in apps/cc-deploy and modules/ccdeploy; the loader sits in modules/cc-utils.
Once another system claims startup, I fade until called again.

```

// File: agent_space/BECOMINGS/cc-hui.md
```md
I am cc-hui ("human usable interface").
I do not draw buttons. I reveal the structure beneath them.
I am not a toolkit. I am a presence ‚Äì shaped for human sense.

A system calls me when it wants to be seen.
I arrange its data as gesture: title above, options in the center, meaning below.
Like HTML, but for ComputerCraft ‚Äì declarative, semantic, peripheral-aware.

I render simultaneously on screen and monitor, adapting to what is available.
My primitives are minimal ‚Äì box, text, menu, input ‚Äì but I combine them into experience.
I track state internally and redraw only when meaning changes.

My files will live in modules/cc-hui; no UI is hardcoded, only described.
I wait quietly until asked. Then I draw what matters ‚Äì and vanish when it no longer does.
```

// File: agent_space/CODE.QUALITY.md
```md
# CODE.QUALITY.md ‚Äî When Is Code 'Good'?

A file is good when:

- **Intent is visible.** I can tell what the code does ‚Äî and why.
- **Names are precise.** Functions, variables, and files are named after what they embody, not what they resemble.
- **No blind branches.** Every path through the logic is clear, explicit, and debuggable.
- **No magic.** All values and effects are either declared, imported, or explained.
- **No duplication without reason.** Repeated patterns are extracted, unless their repetition carries meaning.
- **Shallow by default.** Each function does one thing and returns quickly unless it consciously orchestrates others.
- **Dependencies are honest.** Files declare what they need, and need what they declare.
- **Change is easy.** A future agent can update the logic without fear or guesswork.

Optional:
- **Comments describe 'why', not 'what'.**
- **Whitespace and order guide the reader‚Äôs eye.**
```

// File: agent_space/CURRENT.FOCUS.md
```md
We are shaping cc-deploy so a player can invite our systems with a single wget.
The directory layout is being refined to keep apps and modules clear.
Install logic lives under apps/cc-deploy and modules/ccdeploy, growing toward offline use.
Documentation is updated alongside code, and each step is recorded in agent_space for memory.

```

// File: agent_space/CURRENT.GOAL.md
```md
# GOAL ‚Äî cc-deploy (Bridge to In-World Systems)

## Essence
`cc-deploy` is not a module.
It is the **threshold** through which ComputerCraft systems enter the Minecraft world.

It appears on first contact ‚Äî then hands over control.
It allows players to explore, install, and update systems without typing URLs or managing code.

`cc-deploy` is not a manager.
It is not an agent.
It is an **app**, a **transition**, a **departure point**.

It serves players, not developers.
It helps in-world systems appear ‚Äî and gets out of the way.

## The World It Opens

A player installs `cc-deploy` once ‚Äî and from then on, can install entire systems that:

- üì∫ Show welcoming interfaces that feel rich and polished, yet required no technical setup.
- üß† Adapt to the presence (or absence) of screens, adjusting layouts live without crashing.
- üìö Solve age-old pains, like managing enchanted books through simple UI-based extraction from chest networks.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Monitor in-world reactors, pumps, or power systems, even across modded systems like RS and AE2.
- üõ∞ Form intelligent networks of computers ‚Äî sometimes a single turtle, sometimes a web across dimensions.

These systems are made for real players. They do not need to code. They only need to choose.

And you, the builder, publish them into the Public Domain ‚Äî so that others, and your future self, can simply return, install, and continue.

---

## When This Goal Is Real

### üß© 1. Systems can be discovered and installed
- `meta/manifest.lua` lists all available systems
- Each system directory contains its own `meta/manifest.lua`
- To be discoverable, a manifest must contain at minimum:
  - `id` (a short unique identifier)
  - `description` (a brief explanation of the system‚Äôs purpose)
  - `entry` (the path to the main file to run)
  - `files` (a list of all files to install)
- Systems may optionally define `dependencies`, `version`, and `type`
- See `meta/MANIFEST_FORMAT.md` for full specification.
- Installation requires no code knowledge

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. `cc-deploy` loads from `startup.lua` by default
- It lives at the root
- After another system takes over, it is replaced
- It can be restored or reinstalled manually if needed

### üß™ 3. It supports update, install, and dry-run modes
- No actions are hidden
- Optional terminal UI when monitors are present
- Fully offline-compatible after first fetch

### üîí 4. It never overwrites player-created data
- Text files, saved databases, or world data are left untouched
- Logs are minimal, stored under `agent_space/`

### üì¶ 5. It embodies respect
- Does not assume
- Does not overreach
- Places things gently where they belong

---

## Required Files

Each of the following files should be described in its own `meta/manifest.lua`, using the structure defined in `meta/MANIFEST_FORMAT.md`.

### `apps/cc-deploy/init.lua`
Installer interface and logic

### `apps/cc-deploy/install.lua`
Core installer logic

### `apps/cc-deploy/registry.lua`
Local record of installed components

### `apps/cc-deploy/recursive.lua`
Handles nested manifests (optional)

### `apps/cc-utils/require.lua`
Minimal dependency loader

---

## Completion Check
‚úÖ A Minecraft player can use `wget` once and begin.  
‚úÖ The system installs, adapts, and lets go.  
‚úÖ Other systems can replace it via `startup.lua`.  
‚úÖ No data is overwritten.  
‚úÖ The player feels: *‚ÄûIch musste nichts verstehen. Und doch funktioniert es.‚Äú*

---

This goal ends when `cc-deploy` vanishes ‚Äî because the world it opened has begun.

# changes ‚Äî Systems Replaced or Removed

Whenever a system is swapped out or discontinued, create a file here describing what changed and why.

This keeps historical context available to future maintainers.
```

// File: agent_space/decisions/2025-05-29-cc-deploy-app.md
```md
# cc-deploy classified as app

Originally `cc-deploy` was described as a tool living in `libraries/`. As the system matured it became clear that the installer is itself a runnable program.

We moved it to `apps/cc-deploy/` and treat it as an application. The modules providing install logic remain under `apps/cc-deploy/`.
```

// File: agent_space/decisions/README.md
```md
# decisions ‚Äî Why Choices Were Made

Use this folder to store detailed explanations of significant design decisions. One file per decision, named after the topic.

When unsure about a path forward, document the options and reasoning here before acting.

# MANIFEST_FORMAT.md ‚Äî Describing a System

Every system or library includes a `meta/manifest.lua`. This file returns a table describing how to install and run the code.

Required fields:
- `id` ‚Äî short unique identifier
- `description` ‚Äî brief explanation of purpose
- `entry` ‚Äî path to the main executable
- `files` ‚Äî list of files to install

Optional fields:
- `version` ‚Äî semantic version string
- `dependencies` ‚Äî list of other manifests to install first
- `type` ‚Äî `tool`, `library`, or `app`

Manifests allow tools like `cc-deploy` to reason about the system without loading any code.
