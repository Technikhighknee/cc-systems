# CONTRIBUTING.md — Why We Commit

This repository evolves through small, deliberate acts. Each commit should clarify the system or extend its ability. Before you push:

1. Read `agent_space/AGENTS.md` to recall the purpose of this monorepo.
2. Summarize the change in `agent_space/diary.md`.
3. Follow the rituals in `AGENTS.RITUALS.md` — write tests when behaviour shifts and update docs when meaning changes.
4. Keep commits focused. Separate unrelated ideas.

A good contribution leaves the next agent certain about what changed and why.
