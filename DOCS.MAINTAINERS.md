# DOCS.MAINTAINERS.md â€” For Those Who Maintain

Maintainer documentation is minimal and exact. It covers setup, deployment, and troubleshooting.

- Assume the reader knows Lua and ComputerCraft basics.
- Document any scripts or tools needed to work on the system.
- Link to relevant tests and manifests.

Keep it short: enough to pick up the work after months away.
