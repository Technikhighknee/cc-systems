# GOALS.GUIDE.md â€” Speaking of Futures

Goals describe where the system wants to go. They are written for humans and agents alike.

- Phrase goals as transformations or capabilities, not implementation tasks.
- Keep them short and evocative.
- When a goal is adopted, add it to `meta/goals.lua`.
- When a goal is completed, note the commit in `agent_space/changelog.md`.

A clear goal invites coherent action.
