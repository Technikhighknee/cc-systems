# STRUCTURE.GUIDE.md — Where Things Belong

A clear layout keeps the repository easy to navigate. Each piece has a clear place.

- `apps/` — runnable programs named `cc-{name}`.
- `modules/` — reusable components named `cc-{name}`.
- `dev/` — development helpers and tests.
- `agent_space/` — logs, goals, and reflective documents.
- `meta/` — repository-wide manifests and indices.

When adding a new element, choose the location that matches its role. Consistent structure helps both human and agent understand the whole.
