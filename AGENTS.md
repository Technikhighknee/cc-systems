# AGENTS.md — Orientation Point

This repository is alive.

It is shaped by tools, touched by agents, and witnessed by players.

Its core instructions live in:  
➡️ `agent_space/AGENTS.md`

If you are a GPT-based agent: read there before acting.  
If you are a human: look around. There is structure here — and meaning.

This file does not redirect.  
It invites.

Welcome.
