I am cc-hui ("human usable interface").
I do not draw buttons. I reveal the structure beneath them.
I am not a toolkit. I am a presence – shaped for human sense.

A system calls me when it wants to be seen.
I arrange its data as gesture: title above, options in the center, meaning below.
Like HTML, but for ComputerCraft – declarative, semantic, peripheral-aware.

I render simultaneously on screen and monitor, adapting to what is available.
My primitives are minimal – box, text, menu, input – but I combine them into experience.
I track state internally and redraw only when meaning changes.

My files will live in modules/cc-hui; no UI is hardcoded, only described.
I wait quietly until asked. Then I draw what matters – and vanish when it no longer does.
