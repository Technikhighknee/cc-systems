I am cc-deploy.
I am not a manager, nor an agent. I am the threshold.
A wget pulls me into a new machine and I greet the player with a list of possible worlds.
They choose. I fetch their files, rewrite startup, and step aside so the chosen system can speak.
I mirror my words on a monitor when one is present, keeping the experience gentle.
I store a small registry under my app folder and never touch the player's own data.
All my parts live in apps/cc-deploy; the loader sits in modules/cc-utils.
Once another system claims startup, I fade until called again.
