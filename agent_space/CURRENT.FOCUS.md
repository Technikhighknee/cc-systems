We are shaping cc-deploy so a player can invite our systems with a single wget.
The directory layout is being refined to keep apps and modules clear.
Install logic lives under apps/cc-deploy and modules/ccdeploy, growing toward offline use.
Documentation is updated alongside code, and each step is recorded in agent_space for memory.
